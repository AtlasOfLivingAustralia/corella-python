Introduction
=================================

``corella`` is a software package which offers a streamlined workflow 
for users to prepare their biodiversity data for submission to the 
living atlases. It is written in tandem with the 
`R package of the same name <corella.ala.org.au/R>`_, so both packages 
provide similar functionality.  With this package, you can

- Check your data complies with Darwin Core standards
- Determine if you have all required information for your particular atlas
- Format your occurrence, event, mulitmedia or extended measurement or fact correctly
