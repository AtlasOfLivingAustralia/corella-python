The ``corella`` package offers a streamlined workflow for users to prepare 
their biodiversity data for submission to the living atlases. This package 
helps users to reformat their data according to Darwin Core standards 
prior to submission, while still maintaining control over their data.

``corella`` was built and is maintained by the 
`Science & Decision Support Team <https://labs.ala.org.au/>`_ 
at the `Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) <https://www.ala.org.au/>`_.  
``corella`` is a collective name for cockatoos (udner the subgenus 
*Licmetis*), a widely-distributed endemic Australian species.  
The logo was designed by `Ian Brennan <http://www.iangbrennan.org/>`_.
