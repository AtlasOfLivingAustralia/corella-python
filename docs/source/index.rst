``corella`` is an R package that helps users standardize their data using the 
`Darwin Core <https://dwc.tdwg.org/>`_ data standard, used for biodiversity data 
like species occurrences. corella provides tools to prepare, manipulate and 
validate data against the standardâ€™s criteria. Once standardized, data can be 
subsequently shared as a `Darwin Core Archive <https://ipt.gbif.org/manual/en/ipt/latest/dwca-guide#what-is-darwin-core-archive-dwc-a>`_ 
and published to open data infrastructures like the 
`Atlas of Living Australia <https://www.ala.org.au/>`_ and `GBIF <https://www.gbif.org/>`_.

``corella`` was built, and is maintained, by the 
`Science & Decision Support Team <https://labs.ala.org.au/>`_ at the 
`Atlas of Living Australia <https://www.ala.org.au/>`_ (ALA). It is 
named for the Little Corella (`*Cacatua sanguinea* <https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https%3A//biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/34b31e86-7ade-4cba-960f-82a6ae586206>`_). 
The logo was designed by `Dax Kellie <https://daxkellie.com/>`_.
